# Linear Regression Analysis
### Susie Mueller

## Objectives

In this project, you will implement an analysis pipeline to apply and interpret linear regression on the Iris dataset and other CSV-based datasets. You will enhance your plotting functions to visualize fitted regression lines and explore how overfitting can occur when modeling data.

## Goals

- Fit linear regression models with one or more independent variables.
- Assess the quality of the regression fit using evaluation metrics.
- Visualize and interpret linear regression results.
- Explore the concept of overfitting in regression models.


## Tools & Libraries

- **Python** - primary programming language
- **NumPy** – for numerical computation  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for iterative coding, analysis, and presentation
